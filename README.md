### ROS2 Teleoperation Component

This React component can be used to send velocity commands to a ROS2 based mobile robot. Additionally, robot state information is visualized.

The robot can be controlled via buttons, a joystick-component or a gamepad.

The component automatically connects to a [ros2-web-bridge](https://github.com/RobotWebTools/ros2-web-bridge) via WebSocá¸±ets on localhost.
